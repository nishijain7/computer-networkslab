1. Implement 3 nodes point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the 
queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped. 

2. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology 
consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion. 

3. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot 
congestion window for different source/destination
